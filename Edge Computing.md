Edge computing is about placing computer workloads as close as possible to the edge.
The edge is where the data is being created and actions are occuring in the network.
Example: IoT, sensors which are edge computing machines send unfiltered data mindlessly to the central servers where the work happens.
Edge computing is putting more brainpower into the edge machines. Small inexpensive computer are evolving fast so we have the technology for it.

Data Processing
Edge machines can now filter the data such that the data being sent is of much less volume. This allows central servers to work on much more data than previously available. Another benefit is low stimulus-response times. Sensors and actuators can be attached to the same device so the data doesn't have to do a round trip.
